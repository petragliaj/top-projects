<h1>TOP Project 1: Odin Recipes</h1>

The goal of this project is to understand the fundamental concepts of HTML that I have learnt so far from The Odin Project, by building a recipes website that will consist of a main page index and links to a few favourite recipes of mine.

I will utilise basic elements and attributes such as boilerplate, head, body, headings, paragraphs, links, lists, images and more to construct this website and hope to further develop my understanding of how they work.
